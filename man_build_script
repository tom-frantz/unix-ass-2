NAME
	build_script - build the linux kernel

SYNOPSIS
	build_script

DESCRIPTION
	build_script downloads the raspberrypi/linux repository and compiles it
	with a custom config as specified by the .config file in the assignment
	repository. It starts by downloading both s3719834's unix a2 repository
	and the linux repository. Next, it copies the .config file out of the 
	unix a2 repository, and places it accordingly in the linux directory.
	It begins the process of building the kernel by starting both 
	performance scripts found in the unix a2 repository (first_performance
	and second_performance) as background scripts that run while the kernel
	make command is executing. Once done, it proceeds to kill both programs
	gracefully and copy the files over to the /boot/ directory of the pi, 
	creating appropriate backups as needed.

OPTIONS
	There are no options

FILES

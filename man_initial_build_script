NAME

	initial_build_script

DESCRIPTION
	This script downloads the raspberrypi/linux repository and compiles it
	with a custom config as created by the user of this script. It starts by

	It allows the user to create it's own custom .config file.

	to the /boot/ directory of the pi, creating appropriate backups as 
	needed.

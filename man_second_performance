NAME
	second_performance - Run the LED based performance monitoring program.

SYNOPSIS
	second_performance

DESCRIPTION
	This script toggles the green LED on the Raspberry Pi based on the
	current CPU usage of the Pi. It will leave the LED on for a 
	percentage of a second based on the current CPU load (0% = 0s, 
	10% = 0.1s, 100% = 1s) and then turn the light off for the remaining
	time after such.  

OPTIONS
	There are no options

FILES
	./.cpu_usage
		This file holds the most recent recording of the CPU usage.

ENVIRONMENT
	There are no environment variables associated with this script.

BUGS
	There is a delay caused by switching on, which causes the LED to blink
	even at very high cpu usages.
